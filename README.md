# FIFO-Project
Designed a parameterized Single Clock FIFO in Verilog using Vivado, featuring synchronous read/write, circular buffering, and accurate full/empty flag handling. Developed a comprehensive testbench to validate functionality and edge cases. Gained hands-on experience in FIFO design, simulation, and debugging using Vivadoâ€™s waveform viewer.
